\section{Group Organization}

From early on, the group divided itself into 3 work groups, focusing on three main areas: FPGA, PCB and IO.
This was done largely based on the fact that it has been done similarly in the years before\cn, and it seemed like a reasonable thing to do.
One advantage in doing this is that each work group can become more specialized in their respective fields compared to if everyone were to work equally on everything.
This allows for a more advanced execution in the project, which is a good thing.
The group member work group allocation can be found in table \vref{table:group-allocation}.

Other than this group allocation, no other hierachical elements were introduced.
The group functioned as a direct democracy in all other issues, with no appointed leader.

The group held weekly sync-up meetings in addition to a weekly status meeting with the course staff.
Unfortunately, meeting attendance was lower than what it should have been, due to poor discipline.
Fortunately, meeting minutes were always kept, so information from missed meetings did not go lost.

\section{Tools}

\todo{a huge list of tools that we've used: compilers, IDEs, microscopes, 3d-printers, logic analyzers, software, websites, calculators. If we've used it, it's going in here, and it's going to be detailed.}

\todo{The following is more or less yanxed from dmkons, so we need to go over it and make sure that the numbers are all correct.}
