\subsection{IO device tests}
\test
{Debug connection test}{
    \item{Connect the debug pins to the appropriate pins on the energy micro development kit}
    \item{Turn the debug to OUT}
    \item{Connect to the development kit using energyAware commander}
}{EFM32GG990F1024 listed as microcontroller}
{EFM32GG990F1024 listed as microcontroller}

\test
{SD Card test}{
    \item{Edit the code from AN0030 to use correct pins}
    \item{Compile the code, upload and run it, with SD Card connected}
    \item{Confirm data on SD Card}
}{File with string ``EFM32 ...the world's most energy friendly microcontrollers !'' is added to the SD Card.}
{The file is not present.}
\todo{Is this really our result?}

\test
{USB test}{
    \item{Compile the code from AN0065~\ref{an0065}}
    \item{Upload and run it}
    \item{Run the supplied host PC program while connected to the PCB through USB}
}{The host programs runs successfully}
{The host program fails to connect through USB}

\test
{Serial test}{
    \item{Compile the code from AN0045~\ref{an0045}}
    \item{Upload and run it}
    \item{Connect the host PC to the PCB and run terminal emulator of choice}
}{"Energy Micro RS-232 - Please press a key" appears in the terminal}
{No output from program}

\todo{Buttons \& LEDs? Aleready done, set LEDs 0-7 active if Buttons 0-7 are pressed}

\subsection{FPGA bus}
\todo{The setup of the busses}
\test
{SRAM test}{
    \item{Write a value to an address}
    \item{Read the same address and compare with the value written}
}{The values are identical}
{}

\test
{Running a program}{
    \item{Write data to memory address}
    \item{Write simple program to change memory value}
    \item{Let the CPU run for at least \todo{Make up number here} cycles/seconds}
    \item{Read data}
}{The value is as expected}
