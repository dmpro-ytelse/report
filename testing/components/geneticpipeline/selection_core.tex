    What to test:  &  Test if the selection core behaves as expected. \\

    How to test:   &  Connect the selection core to a BRAM block filled with 
                      fitness values and induviduals, and a PRNG. Then set the
                      counter to N and the enable signal high. Finally, wait for
                      the done signal to become high.

    Pass criteria:  & The selection core shuld read N random fitness values from the BRAM.
                      When it reads the first value or a value greater than the currently
                      stored value or the first value it should store the individual
                      at the next address. After it has compared N values, it should set
                      done high and output the fittest individual.

    Results: &        Successful.
                      The selection core compares exactly N fitness values and only
                      stores the individual if the fitness value is greater than that
                      of the previously best. Finally it sets done high and outputs
                      the fittest.
