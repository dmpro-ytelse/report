    What to test:  & Check if crossover split function performs crossover correctly, from correct bit \\

    How to test:   &    All types of situations are to be tested. 
                        What affects the outputs are the inputs, and the parent inputs            
                        and the random\_number input are changes during the test.

    Pass criteria: &    Changes in parents should cause changes in children. 
                        The output for child1 should have output from parent1 and child2
                        from parent2 before crossover point, and child1 should have
                        output from parent2 and child2 from parent1 after crossover
                        point. 
                        The starting point, which is the first bit in the crossover,
                        should always be the bit number equal to the value of
                        random\_number.

    Results: &      Successfull. 
                    Changes in parents cause expected changes in children, and starting 
                    point for crossover is always equal to the value of random\_number
                    \\
