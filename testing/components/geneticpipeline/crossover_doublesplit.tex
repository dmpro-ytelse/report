    What to test:  & Check if Crossover Double-Split Function performs crossover
                     correctly, from correct starting bit to correct ending bit \\

    \noalign{\smallskip}\hline\noalign{\smallskip}

    How to test:   &    Changes in any input should cause change in the outputs.
                        Therefore parent inputs and random\_numbers will be changed
                        during test.  
                        \\
                      
    \noalign{\smallskip}\hline\noalign{\smallskip}

    Pass criteria: &    The output for child1 should have output from parent1 and child2
                        from parent2 before crossover starting point and after ending 
                        point, and child1 should have output from parent2 and child2
                        from parent1 between the crossover starting point and ending
                        point. 
                        The random\_number with the highest value should always be the 
                        starting point, and the one with the lowest value should always
                        be the ending point. 
                        These points, which are the first and the last bit in the 
                        crossover, should always be the bit numbers equal to the value     
                        of the random\_numbers. 
                        If both have same value, then only one bit location will have a
                        crossover
                        \\
    \noalign{\smallskip}\hline\noalign{\smallskip}
    
    Results: &      Successfull. 
                    Changes in parents cause expected changes in children, and starting 
                    point for crossover is always equal to the value of the highest 
                    random\_number, and ending point for crossover is always equal to 
                    the value of the lowest random\_number
                    \\
