    What to test:  & Check if Crossover XOR Function performs crossover
                     correctly, from correct starting bit to correct ending bit \\

    \noalign{\smallskip}\hline\noalign{\smallskip}

    How to test:   &    Changes in any input should cause change in the outputs.
                        Therefore parent inputs and random\_number will be changed
                        during test.

    Pass criteria: &    The output for child1 should have output from parent1 and child2
                        from parent2 for each bit \emph{i}, where in the random\_number 
                        the value is 0, and child1 should have output from parent2 and 
                        child2 from parent1 for each bit \emph{i}, where in the 
                        random\_number the value is 1.
                        \\
    \noalign{\smallskip}\hline\noalign{\smallskip}
    
    Results: &      Successful.
                    Changes in parents cause expected changes in children, and for each
                    bit \emph{i} in the random\_number, there are crossover at same bit    
                    \emph{i} from the parents to the children.
