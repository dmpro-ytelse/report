    What to test:  & Check if Crossover XOR Function performs crossover
                     correctly, from correct starting bit to correct ending bit \\

    \noalign{\smallskip}\hline\noalign{\smallskip}

    How to test:   &    All types of situations are to be tested. 
                        What affects the outputs are the inputs, and the parent inputs            
                        and the random_number input are changes during the test.

    Pass criteria: &    Changes in parents should cause changes in children. 
                        The output for child1 should have output from parent1 and child2
                        from parent2 for each bit \emph{i}, where in the random\_number 
                        the value is 0, and child1 should have output from parent2 and 
                        child2 from parent1 for each bit \emph{i}, where in the 
                        random\_number the value is 1.
                        \\

    Results: &      Successfull. 
                    Changes in parents cause expected changes in children, and for each
                    bit \emph{i} in the random\_number, there are crossover at same bit    
                    \emph{i} from the parents to the children.
