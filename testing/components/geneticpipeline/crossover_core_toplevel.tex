    What to test:  & Check if Crossover Toplevel selects correct crossover function
                     based on control\_input, and random\_number when in "Party Mode"\\

    \noalign{\smallskip}\hline\noalign{\smallskip}

    How to test:   &    Changes in parents are not relevant, since this test is not 
                        inteded to test the functions themselves, only the function 
                        selection.
                        Every input of control\_input will be tested.
                        Changes in random\_number will be done with focus on the 2 LS 
                        bits when control\_input is "1XX", and in party mode.

    Pass criteria: &    When control\_input is set to 000, or 1XX and random\_input-bits 
                        to 00, crossover should be split with the value of the 6 LS bits 
                        from random\_number used for starting point.
                        When control\_input is set to 001, or 1XX and random\_input-bits 
                        to 01, crossover should be double-split, with the value of the 
                        12 LS bits from random\_number used for starting and ending 
                        point.
                        When control\_input is set to 010, or 1XX and random\_input-bits 
                        to 10, crossover should be xor, with crossover on every bit 
                        numbers that are 1 in random\_number.
                        When control\_input is set to 011, or 1XX and random\_input-bits 
                        to 11 there should be no crossover at all, and output children 
                        should be equal to each their input parent.
                        \\

    Results: &      Successfull. 
                    Each value in control\_input was tested, and set the expected 
                    function. When set to 1XX, every value on the 2 LS bits in the 
                    random\_number was tested, and set the expected function.
