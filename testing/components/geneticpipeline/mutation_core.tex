    What to test:  & Check if Mutation Core selects mutates when allowed, mutates the 
                     correct amount of bits, and the correct bit numbers, all based
                     on chance\_input and random\_number.\\

    \noalign{\smallskip}\hline\noalign{\smallskip}

    How to test:   &    Changes on input will change output. Therefore input will have 
                        changes.
                        Changes in random\_number and chance\_input  will be done with
                        focus to test allowing or denying mutation.
                        Changes in random\_number will also be done to test amount of 
                        allowed mutations, and to test selecting the locations of the 
                        mutations
                        \\
                      
    \noalign{\smallskip}\hline\noalign{\smallskip}

    Pass criteria: &    When the P first bits in random\_number is equal to or higher 
                        than chance\_input (size P), there should be no mutation at all.
                        When mutation is allowed, the next two bits should allow these 
                        amount of mutations: 1-4 depending on values 00-11.
                        Bits 23-0 select four bit locations for mutations, and the 
                        output should have opposite value on these locations compared to
                        the input.
                        If more than one bit location pointer has the same value, the 
                        same bit location should still have the mutation on the output.
                                                \\
    \noalign{\smallskip}\hline\noalign{\smallskip}
    
    Results: &      Successful. 
                    Mutation is allowed only when the P first bits are lower than the
                    chance\_input, the correct amount of mutations were set and each 
                    four bit locations were selected correctly as expected by bits 23-0
                    \\
