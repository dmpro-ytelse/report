    What to test:  & Check if Mutation Core selects mutates when allowed, mutates the 
                     correct amount of bits, and the correct bit numbers, all based
                     on chance\_input and random\_number.\\

    \noalign{\smallskip}\hline\noalign{\smallskip}

    How to test:   &    Changes on input will change output. Therefore input will have 
                        changes.
                        Changes in random\_number with focus on different parts: 
                        \begin{itemize}
                            \item 6 first bits are set to lower and higher/equal to
                                  chance\_input (default P = 6 is used in the test). 
                            \item The next two bits are set to test allowed amount of 
                                  mutations.
                            \item Bits 24-0 are set to point out four different bit 
                                  locations.
                        \end{itemize}
                        \\
                      
    \noalign{\smallskip}\hline\noalign{\smallskip}

    Pass criteria: &    When the 6 first bits in random\_number is equal to or higher 
                        than chance\input, there should be no mutation at all.
                        When mutation is allowed, the next two bits should allow these 
                        ammount of mutations:  
                        \begin{itemize}
                            \item 00 - 1
                            \item 01 - 2
                            \item 10 - 3
                            \item 11 - 4
                        \end{itemize}
                        Bits 23-0 selects four bit locations for mutations, and the 
                        output should have opposite value on these locations compared to
                        the input.
                        If more than one bit location pointer has the same value, the 
                        same bit location should still have the mutation on the output.
                                                \\
    \noalign{\smallskip}\hline\noalign{\smallskip}
    
    Results: &      Successfull. 
                    Mutation is allowed only when the 6 first bits are lower than the
                    chance input, the correct amount of mutations were set and each four 
                    bit locations were selected correctly as expected by bits 23-0
                    \\
