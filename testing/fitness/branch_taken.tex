    What to test:  & Check if the branch address is calculated correctly, and an conditional
                     jump is performed to this address. \\

    \noalign{\smallskip}\hline\noalign{\smallskip}

    How to test:   &  The program in listing \todo{create listing}, is loaded into a test bench.
                      This simple program consists of a simple loop performing some arithmetic
                      operations that store values to registers. The execution of the
                      program is simulated with isim to verify the result \\

    \noalign{\smallskip}\hline\noalign{\smallskip}

    Pass criteria: &  The branch is taken. The instructions located in the $fetch stage$, 
                       $decode stage$, and $execute stage$ are flushed. The results in registers
                       should be X, X, and X in registers X, X and X, respectively. \\

    \noalign{\smallskip}\hline\noalign{\smallskip}
    
    Results: &  Registers X, X, and X is contained in the registers. The instructions in $fetch
                stage$, $decode stage$ and $execute stage$ does not perform any visible 
                changes. \\
