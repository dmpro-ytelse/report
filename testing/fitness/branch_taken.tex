    What to test:  & Check if the branch address is calculated correctly, and an conditional
                     jump is performed to this address. \\

    How to test:   &  The program in listing \todo{create listing}, is loaded into a test bench.
                      This simple program consists of a simple loop performing some arithmetic
                      operations that store values to registers. The execution of the
                      program is simulated with isim to verify the result \\
