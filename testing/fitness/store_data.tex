    What to test: & Observe that STORE instructions stores data to the fake data memory. \\

    \noalign{\smallskip}\hline\noalign{\smallskip}

    How to test:   & The program in listing \todo{Create listing}, consisting of mainly of
                    STORE instructions. These are loaded into a test bench, and simulated with
                    ISim. The memory dump is read after the simulation. \\

    \noalign{\smallskip}\hline\noalign{\smallskip}

    Pass criteria: & The memory dump reflects the stored with the instructions. E.g 
  the memory dump contains x, x , x , x at positions y, y, y, y\\

    \noalign{\smallskip}\hline\noalign{\smallskip}
    
    Results: &  Success!\\
