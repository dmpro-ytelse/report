    What to test: & Observe that STORE instructions stores data to the fake data memory. \\

    How to test:   & The program in listing \ref{testing:listing:store}, consisting of mainly of
                    STORE instructions. These are loaded into a test bench, and simulated with
                    ISim. The memory dump is read after the simulation. \\

    Pass criteria: & The memory dump shows that value 1 was stored to address zero. \\

    \noalign{\smallskip}\hline\noalign{\smallskip}
    
    Results: &  The value of address zero is 1. \\
