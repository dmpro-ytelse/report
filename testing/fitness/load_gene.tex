    What to test:  &  Observe that a gene is fetched from the unrated code, and stored in the
                      specified register\\

    \noalign{\smallskip}\hline\noalign{\smallskip}

    How to test:   &  The program in listing \ref{testing:listing:load-gene}, consisting of LOAD GENE
                      instructions. These are loaded into a test bench and simulated with 
                      ISim. The content of the location of the distributed counters are checked against the data 
                      loaded to the fitness cores.  \\

    \noalign{\smallskip}\hline\noalign{\smallskip}

    Pass criteria: &  The data fetched from the rated pool is the same gene transmitted to the
                      fitness core. \\

    \noalign{\smallskip}\hline\noalign{\smallskip}
    
    Results: &  Success \\
