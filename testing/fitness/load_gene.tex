    What to test:  &  Observe that a gene is fetched from the unrated code, and stored in the
                      specified register\\

    \noalign{\smallskip}\hline\noalign{\smallskip}

    How to test:   &  The program in listing \todo{create listing}, consisting of LOAD GENE
                      instructions. These are loaded into a test bench and simulated with 
                      isim.
                      The content of the  un-rated pool is checked against the data loaded to
                      the fitness core. \\

    Pass criteria: &  The data fetched from the rated pool is the same gene transmitted to the
                      fitness core. \\

    Results: &  Success \\
