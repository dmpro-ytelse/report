    What to test:  & Check if the conditional jump is disregarded when performing conditional
                     that always evaluate to false.\\

    \noalign{\smallskip}\hline\noalign{\smallskip}

    How to test:   &  The program in listing \todo{create listing}, is loaded into a test bench. 
                       The simple program consists of conditionals that evaluate to false. The
                       execution of the program is simulated with ISim, and the results are
                       verified. \\

    \noalign{\smallskip}\hline\noalign{\smallskip}

    Pass criteria: & Execution of the program does not store any data to the registers.
    The instructions are flushed.\\

    \noalign{\smallskip}\hline\noalign{\smallskip}
    
    Results: &   No data is stored to registers. Instruction are invalidated.\\
