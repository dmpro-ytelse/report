    What to test:  & Check if the conditional jump is disregarded when performing conditional
                     that always evaluate to false.\\

    How to test:   &  The program in listing \todo{create listing}, is loaded into a test bench. 
                       The simple program consists of conditionals that evaluate to false. The
                       execution of the program is simulated in isim, and the results are
                       verified. \\
