    What to test:  & Check if conditional instructions are executed when they always evaluate to 
                     false. \\

    How to test:   &  The program in listing \ref{testing:listing:conditional-not-executed}, is loaded into a test bench. 
                       The simple program consists of a set of simple conditional instructions that         
                       always evaluate to false. The execution of the program is observed in 
                       ISim,and the results are verified. The content of register r1 is observed.\\

    \noalign{\smallskip}\hline\noalign{\smallskip}

    Pass criteria: & The second instruction, the conditional \emph{ADDI}, is not executed. The content of register r1 is 1.  \\

    \noalign{\smallskip}\hline\noalign{\smallskip}
    
    Results: & The content of register r1 is 1. The conditional \emph{ADDI} instruction is not executed. .  \\
