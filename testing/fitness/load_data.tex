    What to test:  & Observe that LOAD instructions is able to read from memory, and load the
                     memory content into the specified registers.  \\

    \noalign{\smallskip}\hline\noalign{\smallskip}

    How to test:   & The program in listing \todo{create listing}, consisting  of $LOAD$ and $STORE$
                     instructions. These are loaded into a test bench, and simulated with 
                     ISim. \\
                     

    \noalign{\smallskip}\hline\noalign{\smallskip}

    Pass criteria: &  The stored values is loaded from memory and stored in registers. 
                      The values in the register corresponds to the data written and loaded 
                      from memory. \\

    Results: &  Success!\\
