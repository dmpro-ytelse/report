    What to test:  & Observe that STORE GENE instructions are able to store gene and fitness values
                     to the rated pool.  \\

    \noalign{\smallskip}\hline\noalign{\smallskip}

    How to test:   &  The program in listing \ref{testing:listing:store-gene}, consisting mainly of 
                       STORE GENE instructions. These are loaded into a test bench, and 
                       simulated with ISim. The content of the rated pool is verified. This is verified by performing a memory dump of the rated pool.
                      \\

    \noalign{\smallskip}\hline\noalign{\smallskip}

    Pass criteria: &  The memory dump contains an individual corresponding to the value 1 and with the corresponding fitness value of 2. These values are easily spotted when the initial values of the pool are randomly generated.     \\

    \noalign{\smallskip}\hline\noalign{\smallskip}
    
    Results: & The store of the fitness and gene is confirmed by the memory dump.   \\
