    What to test:  & Check if conditional instruction are executed when they
                     always are evaluated to true.   \\

    \noalign{\smallskip}\hline\noalign{\smallskip}

    How to test:  & The program in listing \todo{create listing}, is loaded into test bench. The 
                    simple program consists of a set with simple conditional instructions that
                    always evaluate to true. The execution of the program is simulated with isim, 
                    and the result is verified. 
    \\

    Pass criteria: & The instructions propagates normally through the pipeline. The different instruction are executed and their results are written to the register file. \\
