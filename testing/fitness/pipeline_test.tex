    What to test:  & Observe that RRI and RRR instructions propagate correctly through the pipeline, 
                     and produce the correct result.\\

    How to test:  & The program in listing \todo{create listing}, consisting of both RRR and RRI instructions,
                    are loaded into memory with the test framework. The execution of the instructions are observed with
                    ISim.\\
