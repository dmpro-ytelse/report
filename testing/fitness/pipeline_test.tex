    What to test:  & Observe that RRI and RRR instructions propagate correctly through the pipeline, 
                     and produce the correct result.\\

    \noalign{\smallskip}\hline\noalign{\smallskip}

    How to test:  & The program in listing \ref{testing:listing:rrr-rri}, consisting of both RRR and RRI instructions,
                    are loaded into memory with the test framework. The execution of the instructions are observed with
                    ISim.\\

    \noalign{\smallskip}\hline\noalign{\smallskip}

    Pass criteria: &  Register r1 should contain $0xBA1212ICECC1$
    and register r2 should contain $0xBA1212ICECC1$ \\
    
     \noalign{\smallskip}\hline\noalign{\smallskip}

    Results: & The contents of register r1 and r2 are according to the pass criteria. \\
