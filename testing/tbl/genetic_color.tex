    What to test:  &  Test a specific genetic problem using the Galapagos architecture. 
                      The problem in question aims to find a specific color, $magic pink$, by 
                      genetic evolution. \\

    \noalign{\smallskip}\hline\noalign{\smallskip}

    How to test:   &  The program in listing \todo{add listing} is loaded into a test bench. The
    programs consists of both genetic and fitness related instructions. Program is executed and
    verified with ISim. The registers containing the best chromosome and fitness values are studied
    during the run. \\

    \noalign{\smallskip}\hline\noalign{\smallskip}

    Pass criteria: &  Execution shall show an improvement of the fitness scores and the chromosomes
    as the program simulates. E.g that it converges against a solution. \\

    \noalign{\smallskip}\hline\noalign{\smallskip}
    
    Results: &   The problem converges and the color is found.\\
