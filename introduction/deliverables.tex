A deliverable is a tangible or intangible object produced as a result of a project that is intended to be delivered to an other party.
In this case, the deliverables are what this group is handing in as a solution to \todo{cite task}.
An overview of the deliverables for this project can be found in table \vref{table:deliverables}.
Here follows a short description of each deliverable.

\subsubsection{D1}

D1 in table \vref{table:deliverables} is the physical manifestation of the Barricelli computer that was designed for this project.

\subsubsection{D2}

D2 in table \vref{table:deliverables} is Galapagos Assembler, a modular \gls{galapagos} assembler written in python.

\subsubsection{D3}

D3 in table \vref{table:deliverables} is a collection of programs written in galapagos assembly for the Barricelli computer, demonstrating its usefulness as a genetics algorithm solver, and also a general computer.

\subsubsection{D4}

D4 in table \vref{table:deliverables} is this report.
