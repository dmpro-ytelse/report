Barricelli, the computer designed in this project, is a general purpose MIMD computer which is equipped with specialized hardware for high performance computation of hard problems using genetic algorithms. The purpose
with the project is to make a fully functional system "from bottom" including both hardware and software. Another goal is also to show how the MIMD architecture is related to the performance of the implementation.
