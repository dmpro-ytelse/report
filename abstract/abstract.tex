Barricelli, the computer designed in this project, is a general purpose MIMD computer which is equipped with specialized hardware for high performance computation of hard problems using genetic algorithms.
A fully functional system was designed and implemented ``from scratch'', however no physical realization of the design survived.
This complicated testing.
