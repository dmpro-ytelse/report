\todo{Put an image of the PCB here}

While the cores running on the FPGA is the most central component on the barricelli system, it would not work without the printed circuit board connection all the components.
Designing the PCB and soldering a working PCB is thus an important part of making the complete and functioning system.

This chapter is a presentation of the PCB, and also explain how the PCB was designed and made.
It discusses how the design choices that were made affected the product.
The power supply, power nets, footprints and chosen components are also explained in detail.
Finally the design and production process is explained and the problems and workarounds that were used are discussed.
