A lot of effort has been invested to make the board as small as possible under the design process in order to make the board fit a small cabinet that was made by the group for the project.
While the various cores of the genetics pipeline are the central components of the Barricelli system, the system itself would be little more than a simulation on some developer board without the printed circuit board (PCB) connecting all the components.
Designing the PCB and soldering components onto it are therefore important aspects of the development process of the Barricelli system.

In this chapter the PCB is presented.
The design and production processes are detailed.
Explanations are provided for why certain components were chosen.
And encountered problems and their workarounds are presented.
