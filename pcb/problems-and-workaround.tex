\section {Problems and workaround}

Here we will talk about various problems we discovered during the soldering process, and how we found ways to workaround them.
We expect that there will be some things that may be possible to work around in code on the microcontroller, and other parts that require hardware fixes.
There might also be problems that cause parts of the board to not function.
