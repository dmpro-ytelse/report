%% Add a picture of the power supply

As our requirements for the power supply were quite simmilar to the requirements of earlier projects from the subject.
The power supply from the Festiva Lente system was reused in our system.
This power supply have been used for many years, with small changes improving the behavior and performance of the power supply.
To avoid introducing new problems, reusing this power supply was a safe choice.
The barricelli system does however not require any 2.5 volt or 5 volt power.
As a result of this, these parts of the power supply have been removed in our system, and only 12 volt, 3.3 volt and 1.2 volt power is available in our system.
