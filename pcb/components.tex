\section {Components}

Here we will talk about the main components that were seleted for the PCB.
This will include everything exept trivial components like resistors and capasitors, as they are mostly selected because of their values and does not affect the functionality of the board.

Memory: FPGA wanted these because they had 10ns access time.

Microcontroller: we got the giant gecko one because we had the dev board for those lying around in the lab and also we picked the model with the most memory? \todo{VERIFICATION REQUIRED}.

FPGA: wait why did we pick this FPGA? \todo{why did we pick the FPGA we picked?}

USB: why does the board have a USB port? \todo{explain why we have an USB port}

SD: why do we have an SD-card slot? \todo{explain why we have an SD-card slot}

UART: \todo{what is UART and is it an I/O device?}

\todo{figure out what components should be mentioned here}
