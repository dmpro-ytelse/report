\section {Process}

Here we will introduse the design process.

\subsection{System design} \label{pcb:process:ss:system_design}

Here we will talk about how the system itself is designed on a logical level.

\subsection{PCB design and routing} \label{pcb:process:ss:pcb_design_and_soldering}

Here we will talk about how the design was transfered to the PCB, what problems were discovered in this process and how they were solved.

\subsection{Soldering} \label{pcb:process:ss:soldering}

Here we will talk about the soldering process and how we worked with that.
This will not cover major problems that needed a workaround (They are covered in their own chapter), but rather the challenges we experienced in the soldering process.
