\section{\Gls{galapagos assembler}}

The \Gls{galapagos assembler} is an assembler for \Gls{galapagos} Assembly that was written for this project.
It is written in python. 
It is designed with a modular, object-oriented software architecture, which makes it easily extensible and modifiable.
The assembler supports the entire \Gls{galapagos} ISA.

The assembler does not perform any optimizations such as instruction re-ordering.
This is because the forwarding unit in the CPU architecture resolve many of the same issues that the assembler would work around using instruction re-ordering.
The hazards that the forwarding unit don't already perfectly handle are few enough inbetween that it is less effort to simply let the programmer manually handle these cases.
\todo{There are cases where the forwarding unit will bubble a little, right? like use after load conflicts? Otherwise the previous paragraph needs to be re-written.}

\Gls{galapagos assembler} is available in PyPi, the leading python package index.
This means that it is easily installable for end users.

The source code of the \Gls{galapagos assembler} can be found in appendix \vref{appendix:galapagos-assembler-source-code}.
