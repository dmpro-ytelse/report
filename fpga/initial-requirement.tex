The assignment requires the development of a MIMD processor architecture.
Therefore, the main requirement is to be able to run multiple instruction streams working on multiple data streams.

The designed computer should be able to solve a limited set of genetic problems.
The aim of the design is to achieve high performance of the evaluation of genetic problems by designing a highly specialized MIMD architecture.
The resulting architecture aims to tackle the given problems with high performance, and high utilization of resources.
