\section {Initial requirement}
The assignment require the development of MIMD CPU architecture.
One of the core requirement is to be able to run multiple instruction streams working on multiple data streams.

The designed computer should be able to solve a limited set of genetic problems.
The aim of the project is to increase the performance of the evaluation of genetic problems by designing a highly specialized MIMD architecture.
The resulting architecture aims to tackle the given problems with high performance, and high utilization of resources.
