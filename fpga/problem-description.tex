\subsection{Problem description}
The designed computer should be able to run a limited set of genetic problems. The aim of the project is to be able to increase the performance of the evaluation of genetic algorithms by a highly specialised CPU architecture. The resulting architecture aims to tackle the given problems with high performance, however, still allow the computer to be general.
