\subsection{Problem description}
The designed computer should be able to solve a limited set of genetic problems.
The aim of the project is to increase the performance of the evaluation of genetic problems by designing a highly specialized MIMD architecture.
The resulting architecture aims to tackle the given problems with high performance, and high utilization of resources.
