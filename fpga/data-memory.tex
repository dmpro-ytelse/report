The galapagos architecture is MIMD architecture with shared memory. This imposes problems when more fitness cores need to access the memory simultaneously. In order to overcome this problem the access to the memory is controlled with a memory controller. The responsibility of the memory controller is granting access and performing memory related tasks on behalf of the requesting fitness cores. The controller is constructed in a way that only allows one fitness core to be able to carry out a memory request at a single time. In case of multiple memory requests, the controller performs a selection deciding in which order the requesting cores is granted the bus. The precise technique of selection can be seen in algorithm (?)
