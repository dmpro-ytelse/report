The galapagos architecture is MIMD architecture with shared memory. This imposes problems when more fitness cores need to access the memory simultaneously. In order to overcome this problem the access to the memory is controlled with a memory controller. The responsibility of the memory controller is granting access and performing memory related tasks on behalf of the requesting fitness core.
