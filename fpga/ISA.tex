\section{Instruction Set Architecture} \label{fpga:isa:s:isa}

The \Gls{galapagos} Instruction Set Architecture is the Instruction Set Archtecture designed for the \Gls{barricelli} computer for this project.
The ISA is loosely based on the well-known and tested MIPS architecture\cn, but borrows inspiration from many other different sources as well.

The Galapagos ISA was designed and fully specified quite early in the project, which made it an important resource for the rest of the component design process.

The ISA is thoroughly documented in appendix \vref{appendix:isa}.

One of the requirements\cn was that the ISA should support genetic-specific instructions to facilitate performant genetic algorithms programming.
Present in the \Gls{galapagos} ISA are the genetic instructions \texttt{ldg}, \texttt{stg} and \texttt{setg}.
They are the instructions for loading and storing \glspl{individual} to the genetics accelerator, and configuring the genetics accelerator, respectively.
Refer to the ISA documentation in appendix \vref{appendix:isa} for in-depth documentation about what they do.
