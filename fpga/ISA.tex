\section{Instruction Set Architecture} \label{fpga:isa:s:isa}

The \Gls{galapagos} Instruction Set Architecture is the Instruction Set Archtecture designed for the \Gls{barricelli} computer for this assignment.
The ISA is loosely based on the well-known and tested MIPS architecture\cn, but borrows inspiration from many other different sources as well.

The Galapagos ISA was designed and fully specified quite early in the project, which made it an important resource for the rest of the component design process.

The ISA is thoroughly documented in appendix \vref{appendix:isa}.
