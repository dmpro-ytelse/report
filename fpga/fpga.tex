The Barricelli computer features a custom processor design.
The processor is a MIMD processor designed for high performance genetic algorithms computing.
This chapter describes the processor architecture and documents the design decisions made.

\subsection{Parallelism}

The Barricelli is a MIMD computer, which means that it can execute multiple different instruction streams on multiple different data streams simultaneously, in parallel.
The cores in the archtecture have each their own program counters and may load different data independantly of each other.
Several of the cores share the same data and instruction memory, however, which makes the Barricelli a shared memory model MIMD computer.
