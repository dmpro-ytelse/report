Individuals making up the populations are stored on the FPGA for for faster access. 
These pools can be viewed as caches, since they are small memories placed near the processor core. This is not an very accurate comparison, however, most of the ideas when designing the population storage are actually gathered from caches. Note that the reason for constructing caches in the first place is to increase the performance or access time when accessing data. The same idea implies here, due the fact that it is a lot faster to access internal memory on the FPGA compared with accessing external memory. The procesor take advantage of this fact by storing the current population in memory. This population is further divided to increase the possibility for parallelizing the problem. The rated and unrated pools serves different purposes in the system. The rated pools are used by the fitness cores to store ranked. 


Distribution counter, selection counter
