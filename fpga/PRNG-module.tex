Genetic algorithms require diversity in the individuals to prevent reaching a local maximum, as discussed in section (?) \todo{add me}. 






To achieve this, the architecture need to support a way to produce random numbers for the genetic pipeline.   


To achieve this, the architecture need some way of creating sufficiently random numbers. These generated numbers do not need to be true randoms number, this implies that a psudo number generator will suffice.
