\section{Further Work}
To create a functioning system, care should be taken to not short circuit the board.
Also the oscilator on the board did not commmunicate with the FPGA, and this should be looked into.

The PCB design does contain some elements that could (and would) be left out of a second revision.
For example, there should be a complete debug port for the DK3750, so that a complete bus could be inserted, and not add random wires.
